# SVG Gauge for Vuejs/uibuilder/Node-RED - [http-vue-loader](https://github.com/FranckFreiburger/http-vue-loader) Version

This version of the example requires [http-vue-loader](https://github.com/FranckFreiburger/http-vue-loader)
in order to dynamically load the .vue file without a build step.
This should be installed prior to use via uibuilder's library manager. Alternatively, you can use it direct
over the Internet from unpkg.com. See the example index.html file.

See also the HTML component version for an alternate method of loading.


# To use this example

1) Install the module: `cd ~/.node-red && npm install totallyinformation/uibuilder-vuejs-component-extras`

2) Import the flows.json into Node-RED and deploy.
3) Change the template index.html and index.js files to match the files in this folder.
4) Click on each of the inject nodes - they repeat every 10 seconds.
5) Open the new web page.
